# google-homepage 
This is a project to deconstruct and reconstruct the Google homepage; 
an attempt to recreate the homepage visually.

I was assigned to perform a self-reflection at the end of the project to list
out the skills I have demonstrated/learned with this project.

I have learned a lot, including (in no particular order):

- Most importantly, how to search Google for a solution to my
problems when I'm in a bind.
- How to commit and pull changes to/from Github.
- How to add Bootstrap to an html file.
(I needed this for the app glyph in the corner. This in turn
turned my links blue! Had to correct in styling)
- How to add a glyph.
- How to interpret the inspect element tool and its capabilities.
- Learning in-line styling vs having a style sheet.
- How to separate CSS from HTML and import the file.
- How to properly assign something as class vs id, or in some cases both.
- How to make the page fit into the viewport without overflow.
- Gaining familiarity with display and flex properties and how they all work together. This
also applies to margins, padding and positioning.
- How to implement spans, img's, and svg's.
- Understanding the order of operations inside a div.

Things I could not get to work:

- Couldn't get my spans in the footer to float left/right while also keeping them center.
Prioritized centering them, and letting auto margins make them spaced decent enough.

All in all I learned a ton and ended up more excited about future webdev! :)
